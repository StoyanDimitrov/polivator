# Polivator
This is *very basic* helper application for the polivation feature of Forge of Empires.

## Features
- Handles multi-monitor workstations (not pretty for now).
- Prepares and navigates the social bar.
- Handles the blueprint window (not perfectly for now).
- Handles the Friends Tavern visits.
- After aiding all players displays stats of aids made (rough estimate number), found blueprints (precise number) and visited taverns (precise number).
- Keeps simple stats in the configuration file.

## What needs to be done
- The interface is far from ready for prime-time but does the job pretty well 
- Better handling of the blueprint windows.
- Better paging the social bar.
- Speed improvements.
- Handling the kicked/left/disappeared guildie/neighbor still present in the social bar.

## How to use
1. Open the `config.ini` file and change the worlds list according to your preferences. Add or remove worlds if necessary. Take care to match the prefix of `.players` and `.stats` sections to match the corresponding world key.
2. Open the application.
3. Switch to the opened and logged in game and select the world you're about to polivate.
4. Wait a bit.
5. Profit!

## Build
